   <p> Create a new class called Ninja with the following attributes:

        name
        health
        speed (private)
        strength (private)

        Speed and strength should be 3 by default. 
        Health should be 100 by default.

        The Ninja class should have the following methods:

        sayName() - This should log that Ninja's name to the console.
        showStats() - This should show the Ninja's Strength and Speed, as well as their health.
        drinkSake() - This should add +10 Health to the Ninja</p>
