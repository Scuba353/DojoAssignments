   <p> .punch()
    Add a new method to your Ninja class called .punch(). 
    This method will take another Ninja instance and 
    subtract 5 Health from the Ninja we passed in. 
    Your .punch() should display a console message like the below example.</p>
    <!-- const blueNinja = new Ninja("Goemon");
    const redNinja = new Ninja("Bill Gates");
    redNinja.punch(blueNinja);
    "Goemon was punched by Bill Gates and lost 5 Health!" -->

    <p> .kick()
    Now add a method to your Ninja class called .kick(). 
    Kick will subtract 15 Health for each point of Strength the calling Ninja has, 
    and like .punch() will take another Ninja instance.</p>
    <!-- blueNinja.kick(redNinja);
    "Bill Gates was kicked by Goemon and lost 15 Health!" -->

    <p>Validations
        Update .punch() and .kick() so that they only accept Instances of the Ninja class. 
        Hint: You will need to find a way to check the constructor of an instance. 
        You will often need to consult outside documentation to find solutions for particular features.</p>
