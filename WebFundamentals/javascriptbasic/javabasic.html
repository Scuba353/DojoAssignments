            <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object oriented scripting language.  JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions.  JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programatic control over them.</p>
               <div id="descriptions">
                  <p><a href="javascript1">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value.  All JavaScript variables must be identiied with unique names.  These unique names are called identifiers. <span> var x;</span></p>
                  <p><a href="javascript2">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving out variable a value to hold.  THe = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span>var x=10;</span></p>
                  <p><a href="javascript3">Data Types</a> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives:  Boolean - <span>true</span>or <span>false;</span> null- <span>null</span>n aka nothing; Number- <span>42</span> or <span>3.14159;</span> String- <span>"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array- <span>[1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span>{first_name: 'Jane, last_name: 'Doe'}</span></p>
                  <p><a href="javascript4">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to preform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks mased on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplis this.  There are the following conditional statements; <span>if</span> a specified codition is true, do this code in our code block; <span>else if</span> to a specify a new condition to test, if the first condition in false; <span>else</span> we execute this block of code;</p>
                  <p><a href="javascript5">Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programing language, but there all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action fome number of times.  Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop.  Thats a loop!</p>
                  <p><a href="javascript1">Functions</a> Functions are an encasepulation of a code block.  When we call our function this will run that code block.  Think of it as a list of instructions.  As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up.  Done!  We finised our instrucitons.  Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call or function over and over and over again. </p>
