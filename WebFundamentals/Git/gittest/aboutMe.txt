Favorite book: Girl with the Dragon Tattoo

I grew up in a small, rural town in upstate New York. After highschool I decided I needed to experience more than the constrains of that beautiful little town. I went as far away in state, to save on tuition cost, as I could from home. I spent the next few years in Buffalo, NY studing Forensic Chemistry and Biology. After my masters program I landed myself in Chicago looking for more job opurtunities. I found myself working for Cook County Medical Examiner as a toxicologist. It was a great postion, something new and different every day but then I was laid off.
