		<h3>Narrative</h3>
			<p> I grew up in a small, rural town in upstate New York. After highschool I decided I needed to experience more than the constrains of that beautiful little town.  I went as far away in state, to save on tuition cost, as I could from home.  I spent the next few years in Buffalo, NY studing Forensic Chemistry and Biology.  After my masters program I landed myself in Chicago looking for more job opurtunities.  I found myself working for Cook County Medical Examiner as a toxicologist.  It was a great postion, something new and different every day but then I was laid off.</p>
